    <p>
        This is an authentic Indian naan recipe that's broiled instead of pan-fried. I have made it many times. It goes
        well
        with Indian curry dishes that have a lot of gravy, such as butter chicken.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>⅔ cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C) </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white sugar </li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons plain yogurt </li>
        <li>¼ cup ghee </li>
        <li>2 teaspoons kalonji (onion seed)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Whisk warm water with yeast and sugar until yeast is dissolved. Cover and let stand in a warm place for 10
            minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Sift flour and salt three times into a large bowl. Add yeast mixture, yogurt, and 1/2 of the ghee. Mix into
            a soft
            dough, then knead on a floured surface until dough is smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. Place dough into
            a large
            greased bowl, cover, and let stand in a warm place for 1 1/2 hours or until doubled in volume.
        </li>
        <li>
            Punch down dough, then knead for 5 minutes. Divide dough into six equal pieces. Roll each piece out into
            8-inch rounds.

        </li>
        <li>
            Cover an oven tray with foil and grease the foil. Brush dough rounds with remaining ghee and sprinkle with
            kalonji. Cook
            one at a time under the broiler until puffed and lightly browned, about 2 minutes per side.
        </li>
    </ol>
